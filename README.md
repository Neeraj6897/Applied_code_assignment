# Applied_code_assignment
This is a repository about predicting housing prices. 
In this assignment I have used a dataset provided by kaggle.
This is a general model which can predict the prices of any test case given the features it is trained on.
Its accuracy can be further increased by using advanced regression models like XgBoost Model but it was not the part of the assignment so I did not use that model.
I have taken care of the constraints provided in the pdf and the model is built keeping those constraints in mind.
Take a look at the Model_with_visualization part which will elaborate the process better.
